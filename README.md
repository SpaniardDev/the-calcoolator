# The Calcoolator

A project made for FreeCodeCamp in which it was required to code a calculator from scratch. Made using React.

It passes all the tests/user stories required by the new curriculum.

There's still things to improve, such as:
- Improving the way theming is implemented.
- Refactor the code to make it cleaner.
